# Gender Lego Bricks

Visual-spatial representation of gender identity corresponding to a questionnaire.

### What?

Gender Lego Bricks is a website and questionnaire format that shows a basic (not too complex) rundown of gender identity with a short, sharable link. Further information is explained directly ON the website.   
Each instance is intended to be customized (down to the explanation) to improve upon the base features of GLB, and provide more advanced properties (such as genderfluidity or other identities which are not included by default).

### Questionnaire Format

There are four multiple-choice questions that aim to build your brick (collection of properties).   
- Gender identity: Determines "core groups" and main pronouns. Core groups include masculine, feminine, non-binary and agender. They can be rearranged to show pronoun precedence.
- Bigender identity: Determines if the user is bigender (has mixed properties of selected genders or fluctuates between them).
- Etc. pronoun choices: Determines if the user uses pronouns other than the main ones, or, collectively, any other pronoun.
- Gender expression: Determines main, a mix of, or variable properties of the user's appearance and behavior.

### Credits

This project was heavily inspired by the [Attraction Layer Cake](https://cake.avris.it/), down to the specific design.   
[Allie](https://crit.rip) developed the project.

It is preferable to modify GLB to fit your needs and deploy it yourself if any more resources are necessary.
